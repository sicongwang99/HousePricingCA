Team members: Sicong Wang, Shayan Norouzi

Project Description/Outline:
Explore the house pricing trend in California. Try to classify house pricing in terms of the price, property type and conditions and use machine learning to predict it.

Data Sets to be Used:
CRMLS API: https://api.simplyrets.com/properties

We will use the api of the above link and use the data, JSONified data for machine learning and csv for Tableau presentations.
 
Proposed layout

•	Python code presenting the process of grabbing API, cleaning it and make CSV for tableau.
•	Build a full tableau file presenting any possible information about the properties including a geo map for visualization.
•	Finally in ML:
a)	We will use regression to predict the possible price depends on the property condition; 
b)	We will use pictures to predict the price range of the houses.
c)	We will use Natural Language for Remark Column.

Tools

1.	Python
